* mgcpp, A CUDA based C++ Multi GPU Linear Algebra Library

** Introduction
   mgcpp is a multi GPU linear algebra library.
   It is a wrapper for various CUDA libraries in standard C++.

** Libraries
   These dependencies are optional. 
   Not including them might result in some featrues not working properly.

   - cuBLAS for various BLAS operations.
   - cuSPARSE for sparse operations
   - MAGMA for hight level linear algebra operations.
   
** Dependencies
   - gtest (optional)
   - cuda (>8.0)
     
** TODO
   1. Finish thread context class for managing threads.
   2. Support msvc build.
   3. Add BLAS operations.
   4. Add sparse matrix
   5. Add sparse operations.
   6. Add high level linear algebra operations.
   7. Add benchmark
